To Dudley S. Dean
87 Milk Street, Boston, Mass.

Uncle growing slowly weaker are doing all possible to
alleviate apparent suffering and retard progress of 
disease. He has not regained consciousness since the  
last lucid moments when he asked for Aunt Annie as reported 
to you. In view of his condition and as I have not had 
any word from you I have not called Mrs. Davis I wil1 keep 
you advised.
