Mrs. T.M. Davis, 
			Edgewood, 
				Bethesda, Md. 
Dear Mrs. Davis: 
	The other day Terry wrote me that he had written 
you about the possible need of having him appointed guardian
of the person (underlined) of Mr. Davis. The conservators would still 
continue to look after Mr. Davis' property.
 	I am accordingly enclosing a form of petition to
be signed by you. Please return it to me when you have
signed it. When I receive it I will communicate with 
Terry as to the need of going ahead. 
							Faithfully yours, 
										Herbert Parsons (signature)
										
Enclosure.
