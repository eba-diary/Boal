Dear Miss de Lagarde:

Mr. Theodore M. Davis, in whose estate you are
interested, agreed to leave $1,000,000 to Mrs. Davis in 
lieu of the provisions which he had made for her, as
you will see from the enclosed printed copy of the will,
[codicil], trusts, and agreements with Mrs. Davis, whom I
represent. She will proceed to enforce the agreement and,
as I understand the Rhode Island law, the result will be
that the interest of the person interested in Mr. Davis'
estate will be charged a proportionate amount to make up
the $1,000,000.

Upon figures furnished me by his conservators, 
I estimate that this will mean a reduction in the amount
of each interest to 67.78% or possibly 73% of what it
otherwise would have been. One "part" (meaning thereby
the parts in the two trusts added together) would therefore
be $33,890 or possible $36,500. Enclosed is an estimate 
showing how these precentages are arrived at.

At a meeting of many who were largely interested
in the estate, it was decided that a meeting of all 
interested should be held at this office on Friday morning,
March 12th, at half past ten. We regret that you cannot be present
or represented. You will appreciate that it is 
desirable that no publicity be given to these matters
for the present.

Although I am named as an executor, it is not
my intention to qualify, at least until the matter of
carrying out the $1,000,000 agreement with Mrs. Davis

is settled, for I believe not only that it must be 
enforced as a binding agreement, but also that it represents 
the wishs of Mr. Davis.
Very truly yours,
Herbert Faion
