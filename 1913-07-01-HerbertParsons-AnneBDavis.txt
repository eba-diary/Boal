Dear Mrs. Davis:

Please accept my thanks for your courteous
letter of June 26th. I will do all I can to protect your
interests. 

So far as the allowance contract is concerned,
I do not think you have real cause to worry. It
is a husband's duty to support a wife in accordance with
his means and the standard of living to which she is 
accustomed. No agreement is necessary. In fact such an
agreement is strictly not legal. It is merely an indication
of what the parties thought was a suitable amount.
Should there be any stoppage of the allowance, which I
hardly think they would be foolish enough to permit, legal
proceedings would soon place you in a position to secure it.

So far as the other contract is concerned,
the situation is that, in consideration of the agreement which
Mr. Davis made, you did certain things which he desired, that
made it a valid contract and gave you a claim for that amount
on the estate of Mr. Davis. If, while he was capable of so
doing, he did not make a will as he then promised, your claim
cannot now make a new will. The validity of the contract continues,
however, and can be asserted when the time comes. If 
Mr. Davis is not mentally in condition to make a good will, he
could not authorize the Hospital Trust to change his will or
assume such an obligation. Nor do such institutions do so
of their own accord. 

Mr. Davis' will probably means so much to so
many people that any attempt to have any part of his estate
appropriated now for any particular purpose might only lead
to litigation later on. While I may change my opinion 
in this respect, at present I think you had better let 
matters rest as they are.
Yours very truly,
Herbert Parsons
