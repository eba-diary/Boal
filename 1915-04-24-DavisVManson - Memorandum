MEMORANDUM
April 24, 1915
Davis v. Manson

Mr. Boal today gave the following account of his
interview with Mr. Davis at the time that Mr. Davis
wrote out the Million Dollar Agreement. Mr. Davis
told him that he had made a trust in order to avoid
taxation at his [dath]. He did not give the name of 
the Trustee, but avoided doing so. He said that Mrs.
Davis was not a business woman, and would not understand
it, so there was no use of raising that point. He 
said that he was also making a trust of lands in
Michigan, and that that required Mrs. Davis' waiver.
He said it was a very important matter.
