Mrs. Theodore M. Davis, 
Bethesda, Md.

Dear Madam:- 
We thank you for your note of the 23rd enclosing brief
biography of your husband, the late Theodore M. Davis, which, together
with the data we have in our files we think will enable us to prepare an outline biography for 
THE NATIONAL CYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN BIOGRAPHY. As previously advised, pre-
liminary proof will be submitted for your suggestions in due course. 

Very truly yours, 
GEORGE DERBY, Editor
