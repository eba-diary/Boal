Boston, Mass.

Dear Dudley:

Today I have a telegram from Terry, saying that Mrs. Andrews proposes to leave voluntarily this afternoon, and has arranged with the Wilsons to stop over at a hotel in Washington, and that Miss Ghio is going on a visit to her uncle in Virginia, is feeling fairly well, but needs a rest, and that Mrs. Andrews made her going a condition of her own leaving. Terry is concerned that a guardian of the person he appointed, but I judge from his telegram      that he fears that unless proceedings are promptly started Mrs. Andrews may pursue a course which will complicate matters. Will you let me know your views. I enclose a copy of a letter to me which Terry has sent me to forward to you.

Very truly yours,

(Sd) Herbert Parsons.

Enclosure.
