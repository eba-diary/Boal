Dear Annie, 

It will be wise for you to sign the waiver of dower [] I send by Terry, as
in consideration of this, and like other signatures you have given, I agree to have the
request of one hundred thousand dollars made to you in my last will raised to one 
million dollars with a clause stating that in case you die before me this request shall
be given to your heirs.

It is understood that in consideration of this large provision you are to give up all 
claims against my estate. If you sign the waiver Terry will hand you this agreement to

a will I mention [] for your information that I will provide [literally] for Terry
[in BLANK] - affectionately.
