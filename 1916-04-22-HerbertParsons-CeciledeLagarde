Miss Cecile Denis de Lagarde,
c/o General Leonard Wood,
Governors Island, New York.

Dear Miss de Lagarde:

Enclosed I send you a copy of your statement
which you read to me on April 19th, I understand that
the other statements which you have already furnished me
are to be regarded as supplemental to this. For instance,
in the one about the drive to Newport with Mrs. Davis and
Mrs. Andrews will be found just what was said in the motor.

When did you first know that there was a second 
original, in Mr. Boal's handwriting except for Mr. Davis'
signature, of the Million Dollar Agreement?

Did you write any of the Million Dollar check 
of August, 1913? My recollection is that you told me
that Mr. Davis wrote in the words "One Million Dollars"
and the figures "$1,000". Did he write in your name?

As I understand it, you did not out out the stub of the check-book, and your impression nothing
was on the stub.

You spoke of a check for $5,000 which Mr. Davis
gave you to use to come to Egypt with when he should cable;
that he did cable you, but that you did not go at first
because your brother had recently died; and that when you
were ready to go, you were cabled that Mrs. Newberry was
there and it was unnecessary for you to go. Is this 
correct and in what year was it?

In regard to the load which Mr. Davis made to
you, he subsequently told you not to give it back, as in
recollect your statement.

I understand that it was Miss Ghio who had
Perre's clothes, before he went to St. Paul's, marked
"T. D. B., Jr.".

Very truly yours,
Enclosure.

P.S. Will you at your convenience return to me the
testimony which I send you to read.
