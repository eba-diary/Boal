                                                   Death Claim
Dear Sir:

We have your favor of the 23rd instant notifying us of the death
of the insured under the above policy.

According to our records, this is a ten-payment life policy, issued
April 4, 1863, in the sum of $5,000. ,under which all the premium have
been paid. The policy was written for the benefit of Anna T Davis, wife
of the insured, if she survived him, and provided that, in the event of her
prior death, it should become payable to her children.

If Anna T Davis is living, it is our understanding that she is the 
proper claimant, in the absence of any assignment. If she is deceased,
we shall need an affidavit on form #46 in relation to her estate, and giving
the names and ages of all her children, both living and deceased, 
claim to be made by such children or their legal repreentatives.

We want the receipt of proofs of lost and other necessary papers, 
when the matter will recieve our prompt attention.

Respectfully yours,
(signed) Benj. W Loveland
Supervisor of Claims
