Mrs. Theodore M. Davis, 
Edgewood
Bethesda, Md. 

Dear Mrs. Davis: 
	Much to my regret I was unable to get out to 
	see you yesterday when Mr. Sheffield and I were in 
	Washington to attend the taking of the deposition of 
	Mrs. Andrews. The deposition was taken in the afternoon, 
	and we were busy in the morning going over the case. 
	Nothing that seemed to us of real importance was brought 
	out in the depositions. Mrs. Andrews testified that she
	had known nothing about the Million Dollar Agreement
	until after the death of Mr. Davis. She also testified 
	to the great interest Mr. Davis took in his Egyptian 
	exploration and collections. I am cabling Terry that 
	he and Miss deLagarde must be here by the middle of 
	March, the case being set for trial on Monday, 
	the 17th of April. 
			Faithfully yours, 
				Herbert Parsons
