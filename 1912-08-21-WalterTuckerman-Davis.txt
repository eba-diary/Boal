My Dear Mrs. Davis,
It will give me much
pleasure to prepare for you a will containing
the provisions set forth in your letter of 
Augus 18th. I will proceed with this as 
soon as I receive from you a copy of the
agreement which you mention - and which it is important for me to have.

With much respect, yours very sincerely,
Walter Tuckerman
