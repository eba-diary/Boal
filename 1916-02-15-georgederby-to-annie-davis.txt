Mrs. Theodore M. Davis, 
Edgewood, Bethesda, Md. 

Dear Madam:- 

Your note of the 23rd with reference to biography of your 
husband, the late Theodore M. Davis, was duly recieved. We note that 
you have referred the question of biography to your nephew, Mr. Theodore D. 
Boal. We note that he was not to return to America until March. We would 
appreciate you or he sending us as full details of your husband's career
as you can along the lines indicated by the enclosed quesion[sp] blank.
Obituary or memorial notices would also be of assistance. Preliminary 
preof[sp] will then be prepared and submitted for your suggestions. 

THE NATIONAL CYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN BIOGRAPHY is the standard 
authority on on American biography ans geneology. The published volumes 
are in all the leading libraries, educational institutions and newspaper
offices throughout the entire country. 

	It is devoting large space to representative men of local as 
well as national prominence in every section of the United States, and is 
the recognized repository for American family history and genealogy. It 
occupies the same field in American literature that Burkes's Peerage and the 
National Dictionary of Biography do in England, and should not be confused 
with the many biographical publications that are made only to be sold to
those who are in them. 

	Thereis (spacing mistake) no space for sale in this Cyclopedia, and there is
no obligations of expense on your part unless you should wish to embellish 
the biography with a portrait illustrations, in which case a charge is made
for the preparation of the plate and printing the impressions; but this is in
no sense obligatory and need not be taken up until after a suitable biography 
has been prepared. 

				Very truly yours, 
					GEORGE DERBBY, Editor
