<place>Villa Serena, Miami,Fla., </place><date>February 15th, 1915.</date>Dear Dudley;- <p> I return herewith the signed checks which <lb/ n="1">you send me, as well an the receipt for Conservators <lb/ n="2">salary. I think your arrangement with Mr. Lefevre an <lb/ n="3">excellent one and <sic>thoroly</sic> approve of it.	In view of the <lb/ n="4">sad condition of Uncle at present, your advice about the <lb/ n="5">yacht is perfectly right. I simply wished to take the <lb/ n="6">matter up in time and not be caught unprepared. I would <lb/ n="7">advise you to at once close up the matter of the inventory <lb/ n="8">and any other things that we should get done as Conservators. <lb/ n="9"> </p><p> While dear Uncle is not dying he is in a very sad <lb/ n="10">condition and the doctor gives me no hope of any improvement. <lb/ n="11">I refer you to my last letter to Herbert which gives the <lb/ n="12">last move of Mrs. Andrews. I do not think that Mrs. An- <lb/ n="13">drews thought of this herself but I may be mistaken in my <lb/ n="14">impressions. <lb/ n="15"> </p><p> I note your favor of Feb. llth. I have kept Mrs. <lb/ n="16">Andrews and hence Mrs. Price advised continually of Uncles <lb/ n="17">condition and do not feel that this is at all the moment <lb/ n="18">at which to take up the matter she, Mrs. Price, proposed to <lb/ n="19">you. I am very sorry that you have been disturbed <lb/ n="20">in this matter and cannot understand what possible right <lb/ n="21">Mrs. Price has to call you over to New York, and abuse your <lb/ n="22">good nature. I note the request that Mrs. Price makes <lb/ n="23">that I write intimate letters to her Aunt, perhaps I will <lb/ n="24">not have to act one way or the other on this. My last <lb/ n="25">discoveries were to me of such a nature that I would find <lb/ n="26">this a very difficult thing to do. My desire, however, is <lb/ n="27">to bo just as kind as possible and to avoid uny friction <lb/ n="28">or publicity. In his last few partly lucid moments, <lb/ n="29">Uncle asked for his wife; he also stated that he did not <lb/ n="30">wish Mrs. Andrews, but wished his wife. He expressed <lb/ n="31">considerable remorse and has shown a very religious turn <lb/ n="32">in his rambling conversation, asking us to pray for him <lb/ n="33">and often regretting the great mistake he had made in <lb/ n="34">the past. I will write you again in this connection <lb/ n="35">and will continue to send careful telegrams giving the <lb/ n="36">exact condition of Uncle for the benefit of Mrs. Andrews <lb/ n="37">and the people about her. <lb/ n="38"> </p><p> Believe me, dear Dudley, I appreciate the difficult <lb/ n="39">position you occupy and feel that you are filling it with <lb/ n="40">tact, kindness and fairness. <lb/ n="41"> </p><p> As ever yours, with thanks. <lb/ n="42"> </p>
